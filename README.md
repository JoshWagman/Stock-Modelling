This is a simple project aimed to improve my understanding of predictive modelling. 
For models, I use pytorch neural nets, and for data I use yfinance, which is an open source dataset that collects its data from yahoo finance.

First I load the neccesarry libraries and data.

Then I preprocess the data into a normal distribution for the model to understand it easier.

Then I define my model and its forward pass.

Finally, I train the model and evaluate it using RMSE.
